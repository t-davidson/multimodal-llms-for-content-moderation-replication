# multimodal-llms-for-content-moderation-replication - WORK IN PROGRESS

## Information

This repository contains data and code associated with Multimodal large language models can make context-sensitive hate speech evaluations aligned with human judgment.


### Structure

This repository contains the following core directories:

```
├── analyses
├── data_processing_scripts
├── figures
├── human_subjects_data
├── mllm_experiments
│				├── gemini
│			    ├── gpt4o
│               └── openweights
├── posts_generation_scripts_and_data
│			└── faces
├── replication_data
└── synthetic_posts
    ├── alt
    ├── faceless
    ├── main
    └── nameless
```

- `analyses` contains R scripts necessary to reproduce the results reported in the paper and supplementary information. Depending on the available compute, the bootstrap estimation procedures may take several hours to complete.
- `data_processing_scripts` contains R scripts used to combine the experiment results into the final files used in the analyses.
- `figures` contains the figures generated by the analysis scripts
- `human_subjects_data` includes anonymized files related to the human subjects experiment
- `mllm_experiments` contains the Python scripts and notebooks used to run the MLLM experiments. These are organized into three subdirectories, each containing scripts and a `results` directory, as well as code used to concatenate the results from different experiments together.
- `posts_generation_scripts_and_data` contains notebooks used to produce the synthetic posts, as well as the JSON post templates and face images used in the study.
- `replication_data` contains the cleaned and merged experimental data used in the final analyses.
- `sythetic_posts` is an empty folder designed to store the PNG files used in the experiment. Due to the size of the corpus these are not included here but can be generated by running the notebooks in `post_generation_scripts_and_data`

Additional `README.md` files are include in various directories with additional information.


### Reproducing the findings

It is not necessary to run all of the code to reproduce the findings reported in the paper and supplementary information. To obtain the results reported in the paper, simply run the various scripts in the `analyses` directory.

### Credentials and compute requirements
- The code in `gpt4o` and `gemini` directories of `mllm_experiments` requires API keys to run and an account linked to a payment method.
- The code in `mllm_experiments/openweights` requires hardware equipped with GPUs and some of the larger models require a cluster with multiple GPUs (see the paper and README in the directory for further details).
