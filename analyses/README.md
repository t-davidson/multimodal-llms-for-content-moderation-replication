# Analysis Scripts

This directory contains R scripts that produce the main results and supplementary analyses.

## Note

**All files contain references to offensive slurs. Please proceed with caution.**.


## Files

- **`main_results.R`**: Produces the main results figures reported in the paper
- **`main_results_alt.R`**: Supplementary analyses using alternative slurs
- **`main_results_single.R`**: Supplementary analyses using a single-task design

All figures will be saved to the `../figures/` directory. The final version of the each figure is currently provided in the directory.

**Note**: Each script will take considerable time to run due to bootstrapping procedures used for statistical inference. See `bootstrap_conjoint_functions.R` for details on the bootstrap functions.
